# Genetic_Algorithm
Implementing genetic algorithm 
The project contains python script for implementing genetic algorithm technique to solve a single machine scheduling problem. We are given the processing time and due dates of various jobs. Our task is to minimize the total lateness or tardiness of jobs by selecting the optimal sequence of jobs to be processed in the machine.
